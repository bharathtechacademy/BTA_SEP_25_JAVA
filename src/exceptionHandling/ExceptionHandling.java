	//Exception Handling Techniques in Java: Set of techniques that we are going to use to handle the exceptions or control the exceptions.
	
	// Error vs Exception
	
	// Error is an issue that occurs during runtime, and we cannot control the same. Example : StackOverflowError, OutOfMemoryError etc.
	// Exception is an issue that occurs due to logical error, and we can control the same. Example : ArithmeticException, NullPointerException etc.
	
	
	//Exception Handling Techniques : there are three types of exception handling techniques we have in Java
	
	//1. throws declaration. ==> When we know the exception details beforehand (compile-time exceptions), then we are going to use the "throws" declaration.
	//2. try-catch exception handling ==> When we are not sure about the exception, we are going to use this try-catch exception handling.
	//3. throw an customized exception ==> When there is no exception, if you want to create one.
