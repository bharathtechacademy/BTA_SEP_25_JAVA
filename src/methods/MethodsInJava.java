	//How to create a method in Java?
	
	//1. Identify the duplicate code in your program that is going to complete a specific task.
	//2. Separate the duplicate code from the main method and create a block outside of the main method and store the duplicate code.
	//3. Define the method with a meaningful name for each and every block.
	//4. Update the written data type before each and every method name.
	
	//Different types of methods in Java.
	
	//1. Methods without return type ==> the method will not return any data/ value after execution (void methods
	//2. Methods with return type ==> the method will return some data/ value after execution (int, double, String, boolean, char, float, long, short, byte)
	//3. Parameterized methods ==> the method will accept some data/ value as input while calling the method
	//4. Non-Parameterized methods ==> the method will not accept any data/ value as input while calling the method
	//5. Static methods ==> the method will be called by using the class name
	//6. Non-Static methods ==> the method will be called by using the object of the class
	//7. constructor methods (default and parameterized)
